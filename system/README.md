## Environment variables getter with fallback

### Description:
Gets a list variable from either the system environment by name or the provided fallback default values. Sends a dictionary with a dictionary of names that have been resolved either way.

Example: 
1. `variable names` receives a list of environment variable names ["Var1", "Var2"]@0
2. `default values` receives optional default values { "var1": "value1" }@0

### Input ports: 
* variable names: string[]

    Receives a list of variable names to be resolved from the environment.
    
    Example:
    ["Var1", "Var2"]


* default values: {string:string}

    Receives optional default values for undefined environment variables.
    
    Example:
    { "var1": "value1" }


### Output ports: 
* resolved variables: {string:string}

    Sends the dictionary of resolved environment variables as a name:value dictionary.
    
    Contains the environment value if found, otherwise the specified default value if any.
    
    
    Example:
    {
      "V1": "value 1",
      "V2": "default value 2"

* cwd: string

### Output ports: 
* success: boolean



## Timer

### Description:
Sets a timer which triggers `done` port after as many milliseconds as received or specified by `delay.  Timer can be canceled with Ë™stop` (input).

Examples:
1. "timer1"@0 received via `start`
2. 300@0 received via `delay`
3. after 300 ms "timer1"@0 sent via `done`

1. "timer1"@0 received via `start`
2. `delay` set to 300
3.. "timer1"@0 received via `stop`
4. "timer1"@0 sent via `stopped`


### Input ports: 
* start: (string or number)

    Receives the timerId which identifies the timer.
    
    Example:
    "timer1"


* stop: (string or number)

    Receives the timerId which identifies the timer to be stopped.
    
    
    Example:
    "timer1"


* delay: number

    Receives the time in milliseconds that the timer should wait before the `done` port is triggered.
    
    Example: 
    300


### Output ports: 
* done: typeof `start`

    Sends timerId when the delayed timeout is reached.
    
    Example:
    "timer1" 


* stopped: typeof `stop`

    Sends timerId when the timer is stopped.
    
    Example:
    "timer1"
